Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Fairness in eSports Tournaments

Use Case Description
In competitive gaming and eSports, integrity and fairness are vital. Accusations of cheating can tarnish a tournament's integrity. However, the necessary intrusive checks to monitor player setups often violate privacy.

Zero-knowledge Proof Application
An eSports organizing body can use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to confirm that players adhere to game integrity rules without revealing their system's details.
Requirements:
Before the tournament, each participant's gaming setup should have a certified monitoring tool to ensure compliance with the tournamentâ€™s software and hardware rules.
Generation of Proof of Compliance:
The tool uses blockchain technology to monitor the system continuously and generate cryptographic proofs of compliance, ensuring no unauthorized modifications. These proofs claim compliance without disclosing any specifics about the software, hardware, or personal data.
Verification by Tournament Officials:
Players submit these zero-knowledge proofs to officials who verify each setup using the public parameters of the ZKP system, ensuring fair competition.
Continuous Monitoring:
Critical checkpoint proofs may be required randomly throughout the tournament to ensure continued compliance. Players failing verification could be flagged for further review or disqualified.
Benefits:
Enhanced Privacy: Players' setups remain confidential while proving compliance, protecting sensitive information.
Increased Trust and Fairness: Cryptographic proofs increase trust between staff and spectators.
Scalability and Efficiency: ZKP allows for the quick and efficient verification of many participants simultaneously without detailed manual checks.

Zero-knowledge proofs ensure fair play among all participants, respecting privacy and reducing administrative burden. This method secures the competitive environment and upholds high standards of privacy and fairness
